# Repository Content Audit Ledger

## Purpose

This file is the operational memory for the repository-wide leaf-to-root
content audit defined in:

- [23_repository_content_audit_program.md](/Users/vincenzo/Documents/GitHub/BigBrotr/bigbrotr/planning/definitive-redesign/23_repository_content_audit_program.md)

It exists so that the audit never depends on:

- memory;
- scattered notes;
- vague impressions of what has “basically been read”;
- or reconstructing scope from git history after the fact.

Every audit wave should update this ledger with the real state of progress,
findings, remediation, and remaining work.

This ledger is also where the audit must keep explicit track of one important
historical distinction:

- files already touched by the redesign execution program;
- files never touched by that program and therefore still potentially carrying
  old assumptions by inertia.

That distinction is informative only.
It must never be used as a shortcut for trust.
All tracked files are high-suspicion audit targets.

---

## Status Vocabulary

Use these statuses consistently:

- `not started`
- `in progress`
- `auditing`
- `blocked`
- `done`

---

## Baseline Inventory Freeze

Fill this section when the audit actually starts.

- Manifest command:
  `git ls-tree -r --name-only 9dc6cc35 | sort`
- Frozen tracked-file count:
  `542`
- Untouched-file count at audit start:
  `227`
- Frozen date:
  `2026-04-18`
- Notes:
  Baseline frozen from redesign closeout commit `9dc6cc35`. Untouched-file
  count is computed against the redesign execution range
  `c016ec08^..9dc6cc35`, intersected with the final closeout manifest so
  historical renamed/removed paths do not inflate the touched count.

## Program Summary

| Wave | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 0. Inventory freeze and traversal map | done | Baseline frozen from redesign closeout commit `9dc6cc35`: full manifest in `25_repository_content_audit_manifest.txt`, touched/untouched historical-context manifest in `26_repository_content_audit_untouched_manifest.txt`, and concrete folder/wave mapping in `27_repository_content_audit_traversal_map.md`. Final-manifest counts at audit start: `542` tracked files, `315` redesign-touched final files, `227` untouched final files. All `542` remain first-class high-suspicion audit targets |
| 1. Deepest non-Python leaves | in progress | `.github` leaf surfaces are now audited and corrected; deepest deployment, monitoring, and docs-support leaves remain |
| 2. Python leaf packages | not started | Read and classify the deepest implementation packages across models, utils, NIPs, core, services, and `services/common`; touched/untouched status is recorded only as historical context, not as a weaker or stronger audit standard |
| 3. Tools and tests leaves | not started | Read and classify SQL templates, tooling leaves, fixtures, and the deepest unit/integration test folders against the final repository contract |
| 4. Parent package and folder surfaces | not started | Read and classify parent `README.md`, package exports, and parent-level local guidance only after children are understood |
| 5. Narrative docs and planning surfaces | not started | Re-read MkDocs pages, root guides, and planning/reference documents against the final repository state and identify missing/additional surfaces |
| 6. Root contract and build/CI surfaces | not started | Re-read root config/build/legal/reference surfaces and close any remaining contract drift, including on files the redesign never previously touched |
| 7. Repository-wide gap remediation and closeout | not started | Apply the final keep/update/remove/add decisions, including newly required files, then run the full closeout gate and summarize any consciously deferred items |

## Work-Package Checklist

### Wave 0 — Inventory Freeze And Traversal Map

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 0.1 Freeze tracked manifest | done | `docs: bootstrap repository content audit baseline` | Baseline manifest frozen from redesign closeout commit `9dc6cc35` into `25_repository_content_audit_manifest.txt`; exact final closeout repository count is `542` tracked files |
| 0.2 Build leaf-to-root traversal map | done | `docs: bootstrap repository content audit baseline` | Concrete wave/folder sequencing, top-level counts, and paired-surface watch points recorded in `27_repository_content_audit_traversal_map.md` |
| 0.3 Mark untouched tracked files | done | `docs: bootstrap repository content audit baseline` | Historical touched/untouched context captured via `26_repository_content_audit_untouched_manifest.txt`; untouched final-manifest count at audit start is `227`, using intersection with the final closeout manifest rather than raw diff-path counts. This classification is contextual only; it does not lower suspicion on redesign-touched files |
| 0.4 Initialize decision ledger | done | `docs: bootstrap repository content audit baseline` | This ledger now contains the frozen baseline metadata, Wave 0 completion state, and the execution checklist for the remaining audit waves |

### Wave 1 — Deepest Non-Python Leaves

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 `.github` leaf audit | done | `chore: align github automation surfaces` | Audited all tracked `.github` leaf surfaces and corrected real drift: added `.github/AGENTS.md` and `.github/workflows/AGENTS.md` as maintained local guidance, removed stale local `CLAUDE.md` leftovers from the live tree, aligned issue-template contact paths with the public docs/security surfaces, tightened the PR template to the actual contributor contract, and strengthened `release.yml` so the validation gate now runs pre-commit plus the repository contract gate (`make ci`, `uv lock --check`, and docs build) instead of only narrating a stronger standard. Targeted YAML/markdown/spelling checks, full `make ci`, and `uv lock --check` all passed before closure |
| 1.2 Deployment service-config leaf audit | not started | — | `deployments/*/config/services/` plus paired local guidance and service-config truthfulness |
| 1.3 Deployment SQL/monitoring/support leaf audit | not started | — | `postgres/init`, monitoring assets, pgbouncer, static/support scripts, and paired docs. This work package must explicitly judge whether the current monitoring stack is merely aligned or whether it still needs a substantial professional redesign across Grafana, Prometheus, alerts, exporter queries, and operator-facing observability shape |
| 1.4 Docs asset/snippet/override leaf audit | not started | — | `_snippets`, assets, overrides, and other deepest docs-support surfaces |

### Wave 2 — Python Leaf Packages

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 Models/utils/NIPs leaf audit | not started | — | `models`, `utils`, and NIP leaf packages with paired local docs/tests |
| 2.2 Core/services leaf audit | not started | — | `core`, each concrete service package, and `services/common` |

### Wave 3 — Tools And Tests Leaves

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 SQL-template and tooling leaf audit | not started | — | `tools/` utilities plus SQL-template leaves and generator pairings |
| 3.2 Tests and fixtures leaf audit | not started | — | Unit/integration leaf folders plus fixtures and contract realism |

### Wave 4 — Parent Package And Folder Surfaces

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 Parent package/export audit | not started | — | Parent Python packages, package exports, and parent-level local guidance |
| 4.2 Parent folder local-guidance audit | not started | — | `README.md` surfaces across `deployments`, `docs`, `tests`, `tools`, `planning`, `.github`, and `src` |

### Wave 5 — Narrative Docs And Planning Surfaces

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 MkDocs page and IA audit | not started | — | Page content, cross-links, and narrative honesty across the docs tree |
| 5.2 Root references and planning-surface audit | not started | — | Root guides, long-form references, and planning files against the final repository state |

### Wave 6 — Root Contract And Build/CI Surfaces

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 6.1 Root config/build/legal surface audit | not started | — | `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `Makefile`, MkDocs/CI/pre-commit/config/legal files |
| 6.2 Root entry-surface audit | not started | — | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other root current-state entry surfaces |

### Wave 7 — Repository-Wide Gap Remediation And Closeout

| Work package | Status | Commit | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 7.1 Gap-remediation sweep | not started | — | Apply the full keep/update/remove/add decisions discovered during the audit, including files that were never touched during the redesign itself |
| 7.2 Final repository content-audit gate | not started | — | Run the full closeout verification and record the final residual watch points |

## Findings And Deferred Items

Use this section during execution for:

- concrete residual drift findings;
- files to remove or add;
- contradictions against the settled contract;
- touched files that still need real change despite prior redesign work;
- untouched files that turn out to need real change despite never being in the
  redesign path;
- consciously deferred items with explicit justification.

- `1.1` `.github` slice, resolved in `chore: align github automation surfaces`:
  - added maintained `.github/AGENTS.md` / `.github/workflows/AGENTS.md`
    guidance;
  - removed stale local `.github/**/CLAUDE.md` leftovers from the live tree;
  - aligned issue-template docs/security contact links with the final public
    support surfaces;
  - tightened the PR template and release validation workflow to the actual
    contributor/repository contract.
- Deferred to later waves:
  - many other `CLAUDE.md` local-guidance files still exist outside `.github`;
    they must be judged folder by folder against the final repository shape
    rather than removed mechanically in the `.github` slice.
