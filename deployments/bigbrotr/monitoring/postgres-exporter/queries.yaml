# ============================================================================
# postgres_exporter Custom Queries for BigBrotr
# ============================================================================
# These queries expose application-level database metrics as Prometheus gauges.
# Scraped every 30s by Prometheus via postgres_exporter.
#
# Design decisions:
#   - relay/metadata/service_state: COUNT(*) is fine (small tables, <10k rows)
#   - event: uses pg_class.reltuples (O(1) approximation, ~95% accurate after ANALYZE)
#   - No materialized view dependency: all queries hit base tables or pg_catalog
# ============================================================================
