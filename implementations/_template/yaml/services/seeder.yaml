# BigBrotr Implementation Template - Seeder Service Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Description: Seed initial relay URLs for validation
# Used by: src/services/seeder.py
# Run mode: One-shot (runs once at startup, then exits)
# Dependencies: None (runs first in service chain)
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# The Seeder service loads initial relay URLs from a seed file and stores
# them as candidates for the Validator service to process. This bootstraps
# the relay discovery process with known relay addresses.
#
# ============================================================================

# Seed configuration
seed:
  # Path to seed file containing relay URLs (one per line)
  # Comments (lines starting with #) are ignored
  # Invalid URLs are skipped with a warning
  #
  # Path resolution:
  #   - Docker: Relative to /app (working directory)
  #   - Local: Relative to current working directory
  #
  # The file should contain WebSocket URLs:
  #   wss://relay.damus.io
  #   wss://nos.lol
  #   wss://relay.nostr.band
  #   # This is a comment
  #   ws://localhost:8080
  #
  file_path: static/seed_relays.txt
  to_validate: true  # If true, add as validation candidates; if false, insert directly into relays table

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# MINIMAL SEED:
#   Create seed_relays.txt with 3-5 well-known relays to start.
#   The Finder service will discover more relays from events and APIs.
#
# LARGE SEED:
#   For faster initial population, include more relays.
#   Get relay lists from: https://api.nostr.watch/v1/online
#
# NETWORK-SPECIFIC:
#   Include Tor relays if tor.enabled=true in Validator:
#     ws://oxtrdevav64z64yb7x6rjg4ntzqjhedm5b5jqulugknhzr46ny2qwaid.onion
