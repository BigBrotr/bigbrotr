# ============================================================================
# BigBrotr Implementation Template - Validator Service Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Description: Validate candidate relay URLs before adding to relays table
# Used by: src/services/validator.py
# Run mode: Continuous (runs every interval)
# Dependencies: Seeder/Finder write candidates to service_data
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# The Validator service processes candidate relay URLs by:
# 1. Attempting WebSocket connection
# 2. Verifying relay protocol compliance
# 3. Handling NIP-42 authentication (if PRIVATE_KEY set)
# 4. Adding valid relays to the relays table
# 5. Tracking failed attempts for cleanup
#
# ============================================================================

# Validation settings
validation:
  # Cycle interval (seconds between validation runs)
  # Range: >= 60.0
  # Recommendation: 300-600 for production (5-10 minutes)
  interval: 300.0

  # WebSocket connection timeout (seconds)
  # Range: 1.0 - 60.0
  # Note: Tor relays may need longer timeouts
  connection_timeout: 10.0

  # Maximum candidates to validate per cycle (optional)
  # When set, candidates are selected probabilistically based on retry count
  # (candidates with more failed attempts have lower selection probability)
  # Uncomment to limit validation rate:
  # max_candidates_per_run: 100

# Concurrency settings
concurrency:
  # Number of worker processes for parallel validation
  # Range: 1 - 32
  # Use 1 for single-process mode (asyncio only)
  max_processes: 1

  # Maximum concurrent tasks per process
  # Range: 1 - 100
  # Higher = faster validation but more memory and connections
  tasks_per_process: 10

# Cleanup settings for failed candidates
cleanup:
  enabled: false              # Enable automatic cleanup of max-attempt candidates
  max_attempts: 10            # Delete candidates after this many failures

# Network configuration for overlay networks
# Each network requires its own SOCKS5 proxy for connectivity
network:
  # Clearnet (regular internet) relays
  clearnet:
    enabled: true

  # Tor proxy for .onion relays
  tor:
    enabled: true
    proxy_url: "socks5://tor:9050"

  # I2P proxy for .i2p relays
  i2p:
    enabled: false
    proxy_url: "socks5://i2p:4447"

  # Lokinet proxy for .loki relays
  loki:
    enabled: false
    proxy_url: "socks5://lokinet:1080"

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# NO TOR SUPPORT:
#   network.tor.enabled: false
#   (Remove tor dependency from docker-compose.yaml)
#
# MINIMAL RESOURCES:
#   interval: 600.0
#   connection_timeout: 5.0
#   concurrency.tasks_per_process: 5
#   max_candidates_per_run: 50
#
# AGGRESSIVE VALIDATION:
#   interval: 120.0
#   concurrency.max_processes: 4
#   concurrency.tasks_per_process: 25
#
# SLOW NETWORK:
#   connection_timeout: 30.0
