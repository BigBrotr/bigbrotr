# Description: Seed initial relay data for validation
# Used by: src/services/initializer.py
# Priority: Run once at startup before other services
# ============================================================================

# Seed relays configuration
# Note: Network type (clearnet/tor) is auto-detected from URL
# Note: Duplicate URLs are filtered server-side (existing relays and candidates skipped)
# Note: File paths are relative to the working directory:
#       - Docker: /app (so data/seed_relays.txt = /app/data/seed_relays.txt)
#       - Local: run from implementations/bigbrotr/
# Note: Batch size is controlled by Brotr's max_batch_size in brotr.yaml
seed:
  enabled: true                    # Enable relay seeding
  file_path: data/seed_relays.txt  # Path to seed file
