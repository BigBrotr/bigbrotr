# Seed relays configuration
# Note: Network type (clearnet/tor) is auto-detected from URL
# Note: Duplicate URLs are filtered server-side (existing relays and candidates skipped)
# Note: File paths are relative to the working directory:
#       - Docker: /app (so seed_relays.txt = /app/seed_relays.txt)
#       - Local: run from implementations/bigbrotr/
# Note: Batch size is controlled by Brotr's max_batch_size in brotr.yaml
seed:
  file_path: static/seed_relays.txt  # Path to seed file
